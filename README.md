Version 1.0
-----------
Bugs -
          * EXP/Min not calculating correctly

Goals -

          * [Maybe] grabbing data from exilestats such as race records(?)
          * Death tracking
          * Additional race specific details tab- point brackets, records, description etc.
          * Log area to log events (Race start/finish) and at a later date potentially server global messages.
          * [Maybe] Hard-coded list of people who are known to stream races (Nugi/Kripp/Rhox etc)
